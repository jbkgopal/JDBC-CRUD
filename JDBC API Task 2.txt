
Perform a JDBC CRUD API Using Statement Interface

Connecting to a database, creating a table, adding data, retrieving data, 
modifying data and removing data.

Step 1: Set up your Database
First, make sure you have a database installed (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) 
and the JDBC driver for your database.

Step 2: Create a Java Project
Set up a Java project in your favorite IDE or use the command line.

Step 3: Add JDBC Driver to Your Project
Include the JDBC driver for your database in your project's classpath. For example, 
if you're using MySQL, download the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file and add it to your project.

Step 4: Write Java Code

4.1: Import Statements
4.2: Load the Driver
4.3: Database Connection
4.4: Create a Table
4.5: Adding data
4.6: Retrieve Data
4.7: Modifying data
4.8: Removing data

Step 5: Handle Your Exceptions.
Make sure you have a Handle Your Exceptions(like SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.) 
and the JDBC driver for your database.

Step 6: Run Your Program
Run your Java program. Ensure your database is running, and the connection details in the JDBC_URL, 
USER, and PASSWORD variables are correct.

Step 7: Explaination Of API Documentation's.

Perform a jdbc crud API Task

Certainly! Below is a complete example of a JDBC CRUD API for managing a "users" table in a MySQL database using Java. 
This example includes methods for creating a new user, retrieving all users, updating user information, and deleting a user.

First, let's create a User class to represent the data model:

Next, let's create a UserDAO class that handles the CRUD operations:

In this UserDAO class, the getAllUsers() method retrieves all users from the database, addUser(User user) adds a new user, 
updateUser(User user) updates an existing user, and deleteUser(int userId) deletes a user based on their ID.

You can use this UserDAO class in your application to perform CRUD operations on the "users" table in the database.
